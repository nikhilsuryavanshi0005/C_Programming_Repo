C Programming Repository
This repository serves as a dedicated collection of essential programs, data structures, and algorithms implemented in the C programming language.

It is designed as a learning resource and reference point for students, beginners, and developers looking to master C fundamentals and practice problem-solving.

#What's Included
This project covers a wide range of core C programming concepts and common topics:

Fundamentals: Basic I/O, control flow (if/else, loops), functions, and operators.

Data Structures: Implementations of basic structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

Algorithms: Solutions for searching (e.g., Binary Search) and sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort).

Pointers & Memory: Programs illustrating the use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, free).

File Handling: Examples demonstrating how to read from and write to files.

Common Problems: Solutions to frequently asked logical and mathematical programming problems.

Prerequisites

You need a C compiler installed. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is highly recommended.

Compile and Run a Program

Navigate to the directory containing the desired file (e.g., 01_Fundamentals).

Use GCC to compile the C file:

Bash:
gcc FileName.c -o output
Run the executable:

Bash:
./output
